Good Day!

This is a guide to launch an app.

First, you should unzip a file and go to the directory of a file and open cmd.

In cmd, firstly we recommend you to download dependencies, libraries that are used in app.py file.

For example, write commands:

1. pip3 install Flask
2. pip3 install Flask flask-bootstrap

Finally, launch python file by command:
python app.py (if python3 is natively used in your PC).

Thank you for using!

PS: There are several training data, as you have noticed. It is because Flask returns a Memory error 
when full dataset is used for training, so we made trials with several pieces.

PPS: Our dataset is from Prosecutor's office, they also gave a task, I have also included description of the task in this package.
